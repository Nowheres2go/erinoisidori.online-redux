A continuation of a recent kick I've had of painting stills from movies I
like. Buffalo 66' remains one of my favourite movies and a piece of art I hold close to my art (did
you know I'm a bit of a poet too? not that It's important.) This scene in particular is one I've
been itching to do in my semi-realism style for a while (look at me go again.) External from the
movie and scene it was a test on how well I could capture facial expressions (something I struggle
with) as well I wanted to communicate what It's like to be alone amongst company and how interesting
the duality of both the characters are in this scene both looking away with a thousand yard stares
both balled up and closed off one naked and vulnerable yet the other clothed and equally
vaunrable. I was so happy with how this piece turned out that I decided to get it printed as a
poster (a decision hopefully in line with self compassion as opposed to narcissism) It turned out
fantastic and I wrote about the process of getting it printed in a blog post [here](/blogs/printingmyworkblogpost/)
