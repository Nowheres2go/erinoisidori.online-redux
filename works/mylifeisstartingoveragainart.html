                <div><p class="postPagePara">The penultimate piece of my series depicting guys looking away from
                    the camera with their arms raised. Affectionately named after a Daniel Johnston song of the same
                    name as well being something I felt quite heavily at the time (could have been mania). It's yet
                    another still from a piece of media I love very dearly in this case, it's from my favourite
                    television show of all time Twin Peaks. It's also one of my favourite episodes and favourite
                    characters (Season 1, Episode 3 Laura's Funeral) The character in question being Bobby Briggs, a bad
                    boy just trying to do good (A trope that easily wins me over everytime) When I had first watched the
                    show at a young age (too young) Bobby very quickly became this semi-role model for me. He was the
                    king of cool with the potential of having a heart of gold. As I grew up and suddenly found myself
                    being older than the characters in the show, my fondness for Bobby changed scope but remained
                    largely the same in practice. The idea of a young man like him having his life and values shift for
                    the better after a catastrophic event was and still is beautifully romantic to me and something I
                    resonated with quite closely. This episode seems to kick off the start to his change and is chock
                    full of religious imagery and father-son relationships (both things I've been facing and dealing
                    with as of recent) It continues to resonate with me (sorry for the wordiness but also not sorry it's
                    my website, and thank you for reading if you are) Apart from all that I listed above another reason
                    I was so compelled to do this was merely the composition alone. The symmetry of three sets of
                    outstretched arms (Yes I'm counting the plants I could even call it six if I was insane and counted
                    the candles which now, in hindsight, I do) Bobby looking to Christ and Christ looking back, it's all
                    very powerful imagery that I feel in my chest every rewatch, and I'm glad to have given it a shot
                    trying to capture that. (I'll cut it off here to avoid too much wording, and let the painting do the
                    talking for me.) </p></div>
