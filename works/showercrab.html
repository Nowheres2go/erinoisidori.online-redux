<p class="postPagePara">This is a rendition of a tweet I saw from this guy who reviews food while
    eating in the shower. This one was a lot of fun, though in hindsight, I feel as if I went a little
    overboard with the detailing of it. (Upon showing it to the original tweeter it took him a couple of
    months to realize it wasn't just a filter on his photo) This remains largely the only piece of mine
    I've willingly posted to social media. (due to where I got the source material from) What really
    drew me in about doing this is a) I'm an absolute sucker for bathroom tile b) The surreal nature of
    the post and c) I have this weird phobia of crustaceans, so this was a form of exposure therapy. The
    original tweet is linked <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/gazpachomachine/status/1654138930894102528">here</a>
