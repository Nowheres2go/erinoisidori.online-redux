                <div><p class="postPagePara">As of today April 19th 2024, I've finished my last exam and set to
                    graduate/have graduated my two year college course at George Brown. I'm doing my best to try and
                    reflect on the past two years, but to be honest, they've gone by like a blur. (I guess time flies
                    when you're having fun right?) I've learnt quite a bit from my time in college. I am so very
                    lucky to have gotten the chance to even attend and move down here to Toronto in the first place.
                    I've met some of my now best friends in the city and through the college. Never in my life have I
                    felt so creatively inspired, and I believe this opportunity is a reason for that. But now comes the
                    scary part of this new chapter, finding a way to get my foot in the door and breaking into the job
                    market. This redux of my website is partially in an attempt to have something to show off skills
                    wise and because I wanted a place to upload my art online without having to do it through social
                    media. The photo I used for this post is one I had taken the day before my first day of college. It
                    was while I was with a friend visiting another friend in Cobourg, ON. I remember feeling guilty that
                    I wasn't fully present during the visit due to how anxious and sick I was to my stomach in regard
                    to this new chapter. The fact I was still living in my hometown (almost an hour and a half commute
                    from my college and I don't have a driver's license.) and unable to find a place in
                    the city yet didn't help either. Regardless, it was a nice visit overall and getting to visit Port
                    Hope (the name is reason enough for visiting alone) was beautiful. For the first three-ish months I
                    was commuting up and down to attend class normally something like this would have burnt me out, but
                    I
                    was quick to romanticize the whole experience. Getting dropped off at the Vaughan Metropolitan
                    Center, taking it down all the way to Dupont station and then back up again was nice in retrospect now. I think
                    it allowed me to slowly digest the city before moving down, and I'm grateful for those that were
                    able
                    to ensure my arrival to class every day. I wish I had engaged more in some of the extracurriculars
                    offered at the college but for how short my program was and how many classes I had online, it was a
                    bit difficult to get attached. I'm so happy to have gotten to meet everyone I've met so far down
                    here, and I hope this isn't the end of my journey in education for now. In my heart of hearts I would
                    love to go to university and to get a degree in the arts specifically in art history. Thanks for readin. </p></div>
