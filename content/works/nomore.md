Some older doodles I did. Not much to say other than I did these during
COVID while working three jobs, and I was kinda coming to terms with the finality of things? The
absence of things? I guess this could be vent art, but I always come back and find these to be sweet
and interesting (In like a non-narcissistic way) uh thanks for readin!
