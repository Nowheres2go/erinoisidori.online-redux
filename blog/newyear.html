<p>It's Two Thousand Twenty Four! Wooo. I'm planning on making this year count
    if I can. I've been listening to the Daniel Johnston song "My Life is Starting Over" to try and will
    this line of thinking into existence. I'm trying to take to heart Albert Camus's essay on The Myth
    of Sisyphus and finding the absurdity in the futile as an act of rebellion. I've also spouted
    notions of trying to leave the idea of subculture behind and trying to remain "undefinable" (Even
    though I find my own notion a little bit corny) I truly believe we need people to develop taste for
    everything (Not having your own taste is a luxury only afforded by the rich) I want people to have
    bad taste even just to change up the pace (Also because no one could have an objectively bad taste
    for something if they have rhyme or reason to it). Another thing I'm preaching is if you can talk
    the
    talk you have got to be able to walk to walk which is something I'm seeing less and less of and
    something I
    must employ for myself as well. I hope everyone has a great new year and I hope this little thing
    gives you a little something to think about. Bye!</p>
