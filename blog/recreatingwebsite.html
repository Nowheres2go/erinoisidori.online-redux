<p class="postPagePara">I'm redoing this website. Well, this post will be live by the time stuff is
    redone, but you get it. My old one was fun, and had my amateurish charm to it, but when i
    tried to work on it more it seems like I had built a maze for myself too much to really justify
    continuing to work with it. As I'm headed into the work force, I think it
    was also time for a new one. A lot of this has spurred due to my looking for a job and inspiration
    from "brutalist" website design. I'm trying to adhere to that idea while also trying to keep my spin
    on
    things. Thanks for readin.</p>
