<p class="postPagePara">More Movie stills (I'm sorry I'll come up with my own ideas that are
  reasonably executable soon enough) I really like this scene from David Lynch's film Wild at Heart
  where Sailor (Nick Cage's character) is pointing almost directly at the camera with a crazed look in
  his eye (after a pretty gruesome scene) and a cigarette hanging out of his mouth which I find to be
  hard as hell. I did this scene not only because of my liking to it but as another test/practice of
  trying to give depth and direction to his direct point which I figured would be quite the challenge
  (IT WAS) but im also really proud of how this turned out (despite some minor flaws that I decided
  would be unproductive to fix) </p>
