From a time when I was obsessed with the idea of water towers or more
specifically, how they look. The concept of these giant almost alien looking metallic structures
donned with sterile light paints I can't seem to get enough of. What sticks out to me the most is
how they are often placed amongst nature and greenery the contrast of these two things is
aesthetically poignant for me and something I wanted to explore. This piece is unfinished as of now
and the full rendition is yet to be completed. On top of that, it was supposed to be piece one of a
series of
three other water towers makes it a bit heartbreaking that I haven't finished it yet. This cropped
rendition here I feel is sufficient for now due to how proud I am of the job I did capturing the
clouds. I have full intention to not only return and finish this piece but the rest of the series as
well It's more a matter of when I do so.
