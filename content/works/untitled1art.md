This is the only surviving painting of when I started trying to shift away
from working small and doodling and largely remains the start of when I started taking my own art
more seriously. It's a rendition of maybe my favourite visual scene from Taxi Driver with the
burning of the flowers. The idea of this destruction of beauty to start anew is intoxicating and
something I desperately wanted to capture. I'm very glad I did. Im particualary proud how I was able
to capture the light of the flame bouncing off everything as well as getting the texture of the
shirt right. something I wish i had done better was getting the flowers and the greenery right its
something I still struggle with. Anyways, this was "the" start. for me at least
