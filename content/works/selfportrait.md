A rapid fire self portrait I did of myself (out of line with something I'd
usually do) I made this while working on my original website's about me section. It was fun to do
inbetween fighting with flexbox. Nothing else to really say other than I have got to start smiling
more in my photos, and I liked how I turned out. (Apart from the fact it looks like I don't have a
right arm)
Personal Note
Whenever I'm looking back at old photos of myself, it feels like attending a funeral for each
and everyone of my past selves and who I could've been. I know the best way to go about it
is to look back with more sober and knowledgeable eyes, but sometimes I just cant. nostalgia
is a poison and a provocative plight of man
