                <div><p class="postPagePara">As the end of my time at George Brown comes to a close (It's final's week.)
                    I decided that I would use a bit of my tax return money to get one of my art pieces printed! (Things
                    are quite tight fiscally at the moment my bank called me yesterday to ask for help cleaning out the
                    cobwebs in my chequing account.) I decided to do this as a little reward to myself and because I've
                    been having a hard time feeling proud or accomplished of my work. I figured getting something
                    tangible like this done would help fix that (it really did.) I ended up going through this franchise
                    The Printing House, which was surprisingly simple. I gave them a call earlier in the morning, they
                    told
                    me what they required from me. (a PDF of what I wanted printed with some bleed to it) and they gave
                    me a quote and a time of pickup pretty quickly. Shortly after, I finished up my second last exam and
                    headed to therapy. The plan was to hit the place on my way back home. The location was at brookfield
                    place somewhere I hadn't been to yet, and upon arrival I was shocked at how bougie it was, I felt
                    pretty out of place. It turns out the employee who had helped me out was also a fan of Buffalo 66'
                    which made the experience even sweeter. After successfully retrieving the print, I hopped on the
                    subway from Union and waited 20 minutes in the hot spring sun at Queens park for a streetcar that
                    upon arrival was too packed to even board. Despite this, I was unbothered and simply ecstatic and
                    decided to walk all the way back to my apartment. Once I got back, my roommates helped me hang it up
                    and the living room. Everytime I pass it, I feel proud of what I've done (although it's a bit
                    crooked.) Thanks for readin. If you want to see a higher quality photo of the painting and read a
                    little more about what I say about the piece that can be found <a
