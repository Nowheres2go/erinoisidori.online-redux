Over the last I would say year I've rediscovered my love of reading. When I was younger, all I did was read and read which over time got replaced by other distractions. It's been nice to read again, it feels like a productive pass time, and it's something that gives insight or perspective that I wouldn't have thought of previous. I just finished the book The Unbearable Lightness of Being by Milan Kundera which was quite intriguing and I think it's kinda considered the last contemporary classic. It posits a great and essential question of is a heavy more pain filled life worth more or is being weightless or carefree worth it. Next on the list is Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment and to finally get around to Marshall Mclauhns Understanding Media as well as many of Carl Jungs published texts.
