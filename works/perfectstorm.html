<p class="postPagePara">At the start of the month amongst working on other pieces while doing
    school I got a bit obsessed with storm chasers or rather the idea of such a profession/phenomena. I
    just think the idea of chasing down something so monolithic and unforgiving like Nature's finest
    equalizer is awe-inspiring first before it is foolish (Not that I believe in Social Darwinism). I
    can't for the life of me remember where I found/saw what I used as a reference for this, but I'm no
    longer too concerned with that notion. Something I wish I communicated a little better with this was
    the sheer size and form of the tornado, but I had other things I had to do. This is the last of my
    series
    depicting pieces of guys looking away from the camera with their arms raised (It's kinda cool that I
    get to call it a series because I want to) </p>
