<p class="postPagePara">A very quick therapeutic piece of art. I did this out of a classic avoidance of working on this site haha. This is of Nina from the movie black swan when she's submerged in the bathtub or something. I honestly don't have too much to say other than I should start working on smaller and quicker pieces there's a rawer quality to them that I seldom produce. Thanks for checkin this out!</p>
