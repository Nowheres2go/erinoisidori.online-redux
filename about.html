        <p class="text-big">Hey! I'm Erino Isidori. Itâ€™s so very nice to meet you! I'm a twenty year
            old artist (Recent graduate and potential worker in IT) currently based in Toronto, Canada!
            I'm a lover and appreciator of all things art, and it's many mediums.
            When I'm not painting, I might be reading, going out to a live show, or fixing up this website
            (I need to learn javascript to do the cool stuff...) I'm currently engrossed in psychology,
            philosophy, and art history. A big goal of mine one day is to have some of my work showcased in a
            gallery, but for now it is here on my own terms. (I seldom post it to social media I'm a bit shy
            about it)
            Thank you for reading this lil' bio about myself, and if you'd like to reach out to me please do so!
            You can find most of my contacts <a href="contact.html">here!</a></p>
