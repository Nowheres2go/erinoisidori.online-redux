                    if I can. I've been listening to the Daniel Johnston song "My Life is Starting Over" to try and will
                    this line of thinking into existence. I'm trying to take to heart Albert Camus's essay on The Myth
                    of Sisyphus and finding the absurdity in the futile as an act of rebellion. I've also spouted
                    notions of trying to leave the idea of subculture behind and trying to remain "undefinable" (Even
                    though I find my own notion a little bit corny) I truly believe we need people to develop taste for
                    everything (Not having your own taste is a luxury only afforded by the rich) I want people to have
                    bad taste even just to change up the pace (Also because no one could have an objectively bad taste
                    for something if they have rhyme or reason to it). Another thing I'm preaching is if you can talk
                    the
                    talk you have got to be able to walk to walk which is something I'm seeing less and less of and
                    something I
                    must employ for myself as well. I hope everyone has a great new year and I hope this little thing
                    gives you a little something to think about. Bye! </p></div>
