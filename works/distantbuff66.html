<p class="postPagePara">A continuation of a recent kick I've had of painting stills from movies I
    like. Buffalo 66' remains one of my favourite movies and a piece of art I hold close to my art (did
    you know I'm a bit of a poet too? not that It's important.) This scene in particular is one I've
    been itching to do in my semi-realism style for a while (look at me go again.) External from the
    movie and scene it was a test on how well I could capture facial expressions (something I struggle
    with) as well I wanted to communicate what It's like to be alone amongst company and how interesting
    the duality of both the characters are in this scene both looking away with a thousand yard stares
    both balled up and closed off one naked and vulnerable yet the other clothed and equally
    vaunrable. I was so happy with how this piece turned out that I decided to get it printed as a
    poster (a decision hopefully in line with self-compassion as opposed to narcissism) It turned out
    fantastic and I wrote about the process of getting it printed in a blog post <a target="_blank"
