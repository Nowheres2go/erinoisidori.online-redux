                    redone, but you get it. My old one was fun, and had my amateurish charm to it, but when i
                    tried to work on it more it seems like I had built a maze for myself too much to really justify
                    continuing to work with it. As I'm headed into the work force, I think it
                    was also time for a new one. A lot of this has spurred due to my looking for a job and inspiration
                    from "brutalist" website design. I'm trying to adhere to that idea while also trying to keep my spin on
                    things. Thanks for readin.</p></div>
