<p class="postPagePara">A very quick piece I did that I'm not particularly pleased with (I find it to be unfinished and lackluster) I've decided to put it on here because I don't see myself returning to it anytime soon it was more an attempt to see if I could change up my style a little more while retaining some of it. Surrealism is one of my favourite movements (In every medium) Which is also home to a favourite painter of mine (The universally loved Ren√© Magritte) I wanted to see if I could try to operate within it. (Turns out being emotionally inspired by something doesn't always inspire something if you get what I mean.) It is a style I want to come back to just unsure as of when I just know I need something more to say when doing something like this.</p>
