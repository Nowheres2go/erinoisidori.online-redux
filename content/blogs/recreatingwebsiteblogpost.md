I'm redoing this website. Well, this post will be live by the time stuff is redone, but you get it. My old one was fun, and had my amateurish charm to it, but when i tried to work on it more it seems like I had built a maze for myself too much to really justify continuing to work with it. As I'm headed into the work force, I think it was also time for a new one. A lot of this has spurred due to my looking for a job and inspiration from "brutalist" website design. I'm trying to adhere to that idea while also trying to keep my spin on things. Thanks for readin.
