<p class="postPagePara">The penultimate piece of my series depicting guys looking away from
    the camera with their arms raised. Affectionately named after a Daniel Johnston song of the same
    name as well being something I felt quite heavily at the time (could have been mania). It's yet
    another still from a piece of media I love very dearly in this case, it's from my favourite
    television show of all time Twin Peaks. It's also one of my favourite episodes and favourite
    characters (Season 1, Episode 3 Laura's Funeral) The character in question being Bobby Briggs, a bad
    boy just trying to do good (A trope that easily wins me over everytime) When I had first watched the
    show at a young age (too young) Bobby very quickly became this semi-role model for me. He was the
    king of cool with the potential of having a heart of gold. As I grew up and suddenly found myself
    being older than the characters in the show, my fondness for Bobby changed scope but remained
    largely the same in practice. The idea of a young man like him having his life and values shift for
    the better after a catastrophic event was and still is beautifully romantic to me and something I
    resonated with quite closely. This episode seems to kick off the start to his change and is chock
    full of religious imagery and father-son relationships (both things I've been facing and dealing
    with as of recent) It continues to resonate with me (sorry for the wordiness but also not sorry it's
    my website, and thank you for reading if you are) Apart from all that I listed above another reason
    I was so compelled to do this was merely the composition alone. The symmetry of three sets of
    outstretched arms (Yes I'm counting the plants I could even call it six if I was insane and counted
    the candles which now, in hindsight, I do) Bobby looking to Christ and Christ looking back, it's all
    very powerful imagery that I feel in my chest every rewatch, and I'm glad to have given it a shot
    trying to capture that. (I'll cut it off here to avoid too much wording, and let the painting do the
    talking for me.) </p>
