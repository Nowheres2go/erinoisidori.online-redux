<p class="postPagePara">From a time when I was obsessed with the idea of water towers or more
    specifically, how they look. The concept of these giant almost alien looking metallic structures
    donned with sterile light paints I can't seem to get enough of. What sticks out to me the most is
    how they are often placed amongst nature and greenery the contrast of these two things is
    aesthetically poignant for me and something I wanted to explore. This piece is unfinished as of now
    and the full rendition is yet to be completed. On top of that, it was supposed to be piece one of a
    series of
    three other water towers makes it a bit heartbreaking that I haven't finished it yet. This cropped
    rendition here I feel is sufficient for now due to how proud I am of the job I did capturing the
    clouds. I have full intention to not only return and finish this piece but the rest of the series as
    well It's more a matter of when I do so.</p>
