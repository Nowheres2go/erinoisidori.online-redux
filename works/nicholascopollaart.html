                    reasonably executable soon enough) I really like this scene from David Lynch's film Wild at Heart
                    where Sailor (Nick Cage's character) is pointing almost directly at the camera with a crazed look in
                    his eye (after a pretty gruesome scene) and a cigarette hanging out of his mouth which I find to be
                    hard as hell. I did this scene not only because of my liking to it but as another test/practice of
                    trying to give depth and direction to his direct point which I figured would be quite the challenge
                    (IT WAS) but im also really proud of how this turned out (despite some minor flaws that I decided
                    would be unproductive to fix) </p>
