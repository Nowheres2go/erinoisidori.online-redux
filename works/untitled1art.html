                    from working small and doodling and largely remains the start of when I started taking my own art
                    more seriously. It's a rendition of maybe my favourite visual scene from Taxi Driver with the
                    burning of the flowers. The idea of this destruction of beauty to start anew is intoxicating and
                    something I desperately wanted to capture. I'm very glad I did. Im particualary proud how I was able
                    to capture the light of the flame bouncing off everything as well as getting the texture of the
                    shirt right. something I wish i had done better was getting the flowers and the greenery right its
                    something I still struggle with. Anyways, this was "the" start. for me at least  </a></p>
