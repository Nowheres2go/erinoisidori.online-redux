I've spent the last three days working away at making this site actually work now so i can throw it on applications and resumes. I've made a static site generator. made it mobile and web responsive and I've gotten to play around with some more design. If you're on a computer you can hit the "R" key to bring you to a random page, the "G" key to display a grid, and the "S" key to bring you to a secret stats page. I've also turned my svg logo into a 3d spining thing? Oh yeah and you can also use the arrow keys to navigate pages adn 1-6 to choose menu stuff
