                <div><p class="postPagePara">A series of three zines I did with the name "SOMETHING AWFUL IS
                    HAPPENING". I had been itching to do my own zines, and I thought to myself there's no time like the
                    present. I made three depicting the most pressing issues to me at the time. Starting off with
                    convenience store analysis paralysis fueled existentialism (and maybe a little bit of historical
                    materialism if you want to go that far). The second details the silent takeover of LED lights over
                    the warm and inviting incandescent light. (Maybe it's flippant of me to say, but I do believe it to
                    be part of the large puzzle in regard to the mental health crisis) And the third one was about my
                    preparation for the upcoming winter months going through the important (to me) pros and cons of it.
                    It ended up being quite a mild winter, and I was being a bit melodramatic. Overall, these were tons
                    of fun to make, and I'd like to return to them soon </p></div>
